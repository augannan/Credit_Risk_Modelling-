# Credit_Risk_Modelling

This project goes through detailed steps to develop a data-driven credit risk model in Python to predict the probabilities of default (PD) and assign credit scores to existing or potential borrowers. We will determine credit scores using a highly interpretable, easy to understand and implement scorecard that makes calculating the credit score a breeze.
